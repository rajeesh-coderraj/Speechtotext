Revolutionary Model Wav2Vec
Here  I use the  Wave2Vec — a state-of-the-art speech recognition approach by Facebook.
Project        :   Speech to Text in Python with Deep Learning

Datasets/Data  :   Input .wav audio file (we can input own audio)



The Standalone Project was done at the time of pursuing the data science and data analysis online courses by #google , #ibm , #sololearn , etc .The Courses provides a step towards the path of Machine learning and deep learning in great extent and promote me to attend the goal in knowledge acquiring and execute the idea in workable form.



My standalone Machine learning and deep learning project which I initialed the idea during pursuing the online course from IBM, Google, Sololearn ,



Model   : Wav2Vec2 (Wav2Vec2 is a speech model that accepts a float array corresponding to the raw waveform of the speech signal.)



1)Import required libraries

2)Data loading

3)Tokenization - TweetTokenizer & word_tokenize

4)Train the Model:Input audio is fed to the tokenizer which is then processed by the model

5)Result will be stored in the transcription variable.

6)Predict the result
